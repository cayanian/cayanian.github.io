Welcome to Life with Pi! We want to help you get the most out of your learning and become a math superstar (cheesy, but true). To do this, we have compiled some of our favorite math resources as well as our scheduling website.

We offer support in everything from Pre-Algebra to BC Calculus. Please check out both our [General Resources][general-links] that provide support to those at all stages of math learning, as well as the [Course Specific Resources][course-specific-links].
