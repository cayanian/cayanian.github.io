Welcome to Life with Pi! We want to help you get the most out of your learning and become a math superstart (its cheesy, but true). To do this, we have compiled some of our favorite math resources as well as our scheduling website.

We offer support in everything from Pre-Algebra to BC Calculus. Please check out both our [General Resources][general-links] that provide support to those at all stages of math learning, as well as the [Course Specific Resources][course-specific-links].
