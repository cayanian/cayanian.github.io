She joined General Electric Power, and as a true math pioneer, was the first person at GE Power to complete both the finance and project management leadership development programs. She then earned her M.B.A. from the MIT Sloan School.

After having three children whose company was too great to leave, she spent several years as a full-time mom. In 2009, she returned to the world of math as a math tutor, and has been enjoying introducing middle and high school math students across the nation to the wonderful Life with Pi ever since.
